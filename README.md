 - [ ] Creational Design Pattern
   - [ ] Factory Method : Creates an instance of several derived classes
   - [ ] Abstract Method : Creates an instance of several families of classes
   - [ ] Buider : Separates object construction from its representation
   - [ ] Prototype : A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
   - [ ] Singleton : A class of which only a single instance can exist

 - [ ] Structural Design Pattern
   - [ ] Adapter : Matches interfaces of different classes
   - [ ] Bridge : Separates an object's interface from it's implementation
   - [ ] Composite : A tree structure of simple and composite objects
   - [ ] Decorator : Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
   - [ ] Facade : A single class that represents an entire sub-system
   - [ ] Flyweight : A fine grained instance used for efficient sharing
   - [ ] Proxy :  An object representing another object
   - [ ] Private Data Class: Restricts accessor/mutator access

 - [ ] Behavioural Design Pattern
   - [ ] Chain of Responsibility : A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
   - [ ] Command : Encapsulate a command request as an object
   - [ ] Iterator : Sequentially access the elements of a collection
   - [ ] Mediator : Defines simplified communication between classes
   - [ ] Memento : Capture and restore an object's internal state
   - [ ] Observer :A way of notifying change to a number of classes 
   - [ ] State : Alter an object's behaviour when its state changes
   - [ ] Strategy : Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
   - [ ] Template Method : Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
   - [ ] Visitor : Defines a new operation to a class without change
   - [ ] Null Object : Designed to act as a default value of an object
   - [ ] Interpreter : A way to include language elements in a program
